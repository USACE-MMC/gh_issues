Messy script to pull all issues and comments from a repo and display as html in the browser

Usage

The easiest way to use this tool is to have Node installed and use the following steps:

1. download the repo
2. cd to the app folder
3. run `http-server`
4. go to localhost:8080/?owner=:owner&repo=:repo&auth_token=:your_auth_token

* your auth token can be obtained from the github api page here
